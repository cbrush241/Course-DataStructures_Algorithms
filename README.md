# Data Structures and Algorithms Course

This is my coursework for a Data Structures and Algorithms course offered by UC San Diego. I am completing this course on Coursera's open source learning platform.

This repository is divided into branches for each course module, and the source code for each assignment will be uploaded accordingly. All code will be written in Python.
